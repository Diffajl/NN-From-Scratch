# Neural Network from Scratch

## Description
This project is a custom implementation of a Neural Network from scratch without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The neural network is designed to predict a category based on height and weight, classifying individuals into two categories: **short and fat** or **tall and slim**.

## Model Architecture
The Neural Network has the following structure:
- 2 input neurons (height and weight)
- 2 hidden layers, each with a specified number of neurons
- 2 output neurons representing the two categories: **short and fat** or **tall and slim**
